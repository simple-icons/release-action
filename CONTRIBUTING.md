1. Start hacking on the new branch
1. Commit and push to the new branch

Also consider the following, this Action is tailor-made for [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) and changes should always be made with that in mind. If you wish to implement significant changes you are perhaps better off forking this repository.

## Guidelines

Please note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:

- Indent is 2 spaces
- Use `async`/`await` over Promises and callbacks

## Building

We use [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc#readme) to create a single `.js` file that contains all the source code needed to run the Action. This means that this file works without the `node_modules/` folder present.

Therefore, you should make sure the `npm run build` command does not fail due to your changes. Run `npm run build` before making a commit and include the changes in the `./lib` folder in your commit.

## Local Preview

Use this command below to preview the release note:

```shell
SI_REPOSITORY_TOKEN='your-repo-token' npm run preview
```
